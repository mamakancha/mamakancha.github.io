Hi, I am a second year undergraduate student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Patna. I wrote my first <code>Hello World</code> program about two years ago and have been intrigued by the beauty of Computer Programs ever since. I am quite efficient in C, C++ and Python. I am a contributor at [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/)
