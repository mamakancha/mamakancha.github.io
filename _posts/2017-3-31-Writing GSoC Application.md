title: Writing GSoC Application
---
The deadline for submitting GSoC Application is 3rd April and  I started working on mine on 28th March. It took me one day to setup my blog. The next two days I had to spent 12-14 hours collectively to complete my Application. I still need to update my Proposed Timeline though :( . So for all the people out there trying for GSoC, please take a note that it would be a lot better for you if you start working on your Application atleast two weeks before the deadline to make your lives easier. You can work on your patches parallely. Don't save the application for last moment. 
Coming to my Application, I have proposed a project on `Ordinary Differential Equations`. I have researched a lot on this topic and have proposed my ideas of implementation as well. I hope that it is appreciated by the mentors. I am going through a lot of mixed emtions right now. Let's see what happens! Fingers Crossed.
