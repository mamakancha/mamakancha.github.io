title: My first post of my first Blog
---
After an one day struggle , I am finally able to set up my own Blog. Anybody who wants to do the same , you should go through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0idtvxVo9I) video. I have decided to go for `Lanyon` theme using `Jekyll`. However, make all the changes in the `master` branch only as mentioned [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).

I find it very interesting that GitHub allows us to host our own pages using their own servers. Now that's the spirit of Open-Source. I hope it continues that way :)
