title: Getting Application Reviewed
---

It's been two days I have trying to get my Application reviewed. I got a lot of constructive comments from both [Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) and [Aaron Meurer](https://github.com/asmeurer). Kalevi has helped a lot by reviewing my Application twice by suggesting what should be added to the theory, what should I add to my timeline and how should I prioritise among my taks. Aaron suggeste me to add a decriptive timeline. More inputs may come from them. That's it for today. And again I would like to mentione that please start working on your application way before the deadline. Don't keep working on issues alone like me. Application is equally important.

Thanks for reading :)
